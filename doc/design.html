<h1>Freedom Maker's Design</h1>

<p>Freedom Maker creates FreedomBoxes thorugh a two step process:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Building a generic image template that can be used to boot any number of
boxen.</p></li>
<li><p>Booting that image template on specific physical hardware to turn a
plugserver into your FreedomBox.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>From Freedom Maker to Image Template</h2>

<p>Creating the image template is a three step process:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The makefile takes configuration options and runs <code>bin/mk_freedombox_image</code>
with those configuration options.</p></li>
<li><p><code>mk_freedombox_image</code> interprets the config options and runs vmdebootstrap to
generate the image.</p></li>
<li><p>vmdebootstrap runs <code>bin/freedombox_customize</code> to customize the image.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Freedom Maker's Internals</h3>

<p>Freedom Maker is essentially a vmdebootstrap wrapper consisting of three parts:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><code>/Makefile</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>bin/mk_freedombox_image</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>bin/freedombox_customize</code></p></li>
</ol>

<p>The <code>Makefile</code> contains recipes for each supported hardware target, currently
including the DreamPlug, RaspberryPi, BeagleBone, and even VirtualBox Virtual
Machine.  Each of these recipes sets the <code>MACHINE</code>, <code>ARCHITECTURE</code>, and
<code>DESTINATION</code> variables which, in turn, control the type of image vmdebootstrap
creates.  For more manual control over the generated image, try the <code>something</code>
target.</p>

<p>After the makefile interprets the recipe, it'll call <code>bin/mk_freedombox_image</code>
which'll add more context data for vmdebootstrap like which Debian packages are
installed by default and <code>MACHINE</code> specific settings.  From here, vmdebootstrap
builds the image and, once complete, customizes the image with
<code>bin/freedombox_customize</code>.</p>

<p>freedombox_customize adds additional steps beyond what vmdebootstrap is capable
of, like setting default passwords and adding repositories to
<code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code>.  Finally, it installs the freedombox-setup package and
runs <code>/usr/lib/freedombox/setup</code> which prepares the image template for its first
run.  At this point, the image template is ready to be copied onto an SD card
and booted for the first time.</p>

<h2>From Image Template to Working FreedomBox</h2>

<p>Turning an image template into a working FreedomBox is a three step process:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The image template (created in the previous section) is copied to an SD card
or other bootable medium.</p></li>
<li><p>The system is booted for the first time.</p></li>
<li><p>During the first boot, the system configures itself and creates its own
identity.</p></li>
<li><p>When the initial configuration is complete, the system restarts.</p></li>
<li><p>The FreedomBox is now customized and ready for general use.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>The First Boot Process</h3>

<p>It's important to remember that each <strong>unbooted</strong> image is merely a template for
any number of FreedomBoxes: no private key material exists until the image is
actually booted.  Thanks to how the first boot process works, the image is not
actually ready for the end user until the second boot.</p>

<p>After the user copies the image to the SD card and turns on the system for the
first time, the scripts in <code>/usr/lib/freedombox/first-run.d</code> are run.  These
scripts configure and individually customize the box by generating keys and
providing the box with its own identity.  After the first boot configuration is
done, the box restarts and is ready for general use.</p>
